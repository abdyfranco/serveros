.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
SpamAssassin is configured using traditional UNIX-style configuration files,
loaded from the \f(CW\*(C`/usr/share/spamassassin\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`/etc/mail/spamassassin\*(C'\fR
directories.
.PP
The following web page lists the most important configuration settings
used to configure SpamAssassin; novices are encouraged to read it first:
.PP
.Vb 1

.Ve
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
.IX Header "FILE FORMAT"
The \f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR character starts a comment, which continues until end of line.
\&\fB\s-1NOTE:\s0\fR if the \f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR character is to be used as part of a rule or
configuration option, it must be escaped with a backslash.  i.e.: \f(CW\*(C`\e#\*(C'\fR
.PP
Whitespace in the files is not significant, but please note that starting a
line with whitespace is deprecated, as we reserve its use for multi-line rule
definitions, at some point in the future.
.PP
Currently, each rule or configuration setting must fit on one-line; multi-line
settings are not supported yet.
.PP
File and directory paths can use \f(CW\*(C`~\*(C'\fR to refer to the user's home
directory, but no other shell-style path extensions such as globing or
\&\f(CW\*(C`~user/\*(C'\fR are supported.
.PP
Where appropriate below, default values are listed in parentheses.
.SH "USER PREFERENCES"
.IX Header "USER PREFERENCES"
The following options can be used in both site-wide (\f(CW\*(C`local.cf\*(C'\fR) and
user-specific (\f(CW\*(C`user_prefs\*(C'\fR) configuration files to customize how
SpamAssassin handles incoming email messages.
.SS "\s-1SCORING OPTIONS\s0"
.IX Subsection "SCORING OPTIONS"
.IP "required_score n.nn (default: 5)" 4
.IX Item "required_score n.nn (default: 5)"
Set the score required before a mail is considered spam.  \f(CW\*(C`n.nn\*(C'\fR can
be an integer or a real number.  5.0 is the default setting, and is
quite aggressive; it would be suitable for a single-user setup, but if
you're an \s-1ISP\s0 installing SpamAssassin, you should probably set the
default to be more conservative, like 8.0 or 10.0.  It is not
recommended to automatically delete or discard messages marked as
spam, as your users \fBwill\fR complain, but if you choose to do so, only
delete messages with an exceptionally high score such as 15.0 or
higher. This option was previously known as \f(CW\*(C`required_hits\*(C'\fR and that
name is still accepted, but is deprecated.
.IP "score \s-1SYMBOLIC_TEST_NAME\s0 n.nn [ n.nn n.nn n.nn ]" 4
.IX Item "score SYMBOLIC_TEST_NAME n.nn [ n.nn n.nn n.nn ]"
Assign scores (the number of points for a hit) to a given test.
Scores can be positive or negative real numbers or integers.
\&\f(CW\*(C`SYMBOLIC_TEST_NAME\*(C'\fR is the symbolic name used by SpamAssassin for
that test; for example, '\s-1FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS\s0'.
.Sp
If only one valid score is listed, then that score is always used
for a test.
.Sp
If four valid scores are listed, then the score that is used depends
on how SpamAssassin is being used. The first score is used when
both Bayes and network tests are disabled (score set 0). The second
score is used when Bayes is disabled, but network tests are enabled
(score set 1). The third score is used when Bayes is enabled and
network tests are disabled (score set 2). The fourth score is used
when Bayes is enabled and network tests are enabled (score set 3).
.Sp
Setting a rule's score to 0 will disable that rule from running.
.Sp
If any of the score values are surrounded by parenthesis '()', then
all of the scores in the line are considered to be relative to the
already set score.  ie: '(3)' means increase the score for this
rule by 3 points in all score sets.  '(3) (0) (3) (0)' means increase
the score for this rule by 3 in score sets 0 and 2 only.
.Sp
If no score is given for a test by the end of the configuration,
a default score is assigned: a score of 1.0 is used for all tests,
except those whose names begin with 'T_' (this is used to indicate a
rule in testing) which receive 0.01.
.Sp
Note that test names which begin with '_\|_' are indirect rules used
to compose meta-match rules and can also act as prerequisites to
other rules.  They are not scored or listed in the 'tests hit'
reports, but assigning a score of 0 to an indirect rule will disable
it from running.
.SS "\s-1WHITELIST AND BLACKLIST OPTIONS\s0"
.IX Subsection "WHITELIST AND BLACKLIST OPTIONS"
.IP "whitelist_from user@example.com" 4
.IX Item "whitelist_from user@example.com"
Used to whitelist sender addresses which send mail that is often tagged
(incorrectly) as spam.
.Sp
Use of this setting is not recommended, since it blindly trusts the message,
which is routinely and easily forged by spammers and phish senders. The
recommended solution is to instead use \f(CW\*(C`whitelist_auth\*(C'\fR or other authenticated
whitelisting methods, or \f(CW\*(C`whitelist_from_rcvd\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Whitelist and blacklist addresses are now file-glob-style patterns, so
\&\f(CW\*(C`friend@somewhere.com\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`*@isp.com\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`*.domain.net\*(C'\fR will all work.
Specifically, \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`?\*(C'\fR are allowed, but all other metacharacters
are not. Regular expressions are not used for security reasons.
Matching is case-insensitive.
.Sp
Multiple addresses per line, separated by spaces, is \s-1OK. \s0 Multiple
\&\f(CW\*(C`whitelist_from\*(C'\fR lines are also \s-1OK.\s0
.Sp
The headers checked for whitelist addresses are as follows: if \f(CW\*(C`Resent\-From\*(C'\fR
is set, use that; otherwise check all addresses taken from the following
set of headers:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        Envelope\-Sender
\&        Resent\-Sender
\&        X\-Envelope\-From
\&        From
.Ve
.Sp
In addition, the \*(L"envelope sender\*(R" data, taken from the \s-1SMTP\s0 envelope data
where this is available, is looked up.  See \f(CW\*(C`envelope_sender_header\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
e.g.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  whitelist_from joe@example.com fred@example.com
\&  whitelist_from *@example.com
.Ve
.IP "unwhitelist_from user@example.com" 4
.IX Item "unwhitelist_from user@example.com"
Used to override a default whitelist_from entry, so for example a distribution
whitelist_from can be overridden in a local.cf file, or an individual user can
override a whitelist_from entry in their own \f(CW\*(C`user_prefs\*(C'\fR file.
The specified email address has to match exactly (although case-insensitively)
the address previously used in a whitelist_from line, which implies that a
wildcard only matches literally the same wildcard (not 'any' address).
.Sp
e.g.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  unwhitelist_from joe@example.com fred@example.com
\&  unwhitelist_from *@example.com
.Ve
.IP "whitelist_from_rcvd addr@lists.sourceforge.net sourceforge.net" 4
.IX Item "whitelist_from_rcvd addr@lists.sourceforge.net sourceforge.net"
Works similarly to whitelist_from, except that in addition to matching
a sender address, a relay's rDNS name or its \s-1IP\s0 address must match too
for the whitelisting rule to fire. The first parameter is a sender's e\-mail
address to whitelist, and the second is a string to match the relay's rDNS,
or its \s-1IP\s0 address. Matching is case-insensitive.
.Sp
This second parameter is matched against the TCP-info information field as
provided in a \s-1FROM\s0 clause of a trace information (i.e. the Received header
field, see \s-1RFC 5321\s0). Only the Received header fields inserted by trusted
hosts are considered. This parameter can either be a full hostname, or the
domain component of that hostname, or an \s-1IP\s0 address in square brackets.
The reverse \s-1DNS\s0 lookup is done by a \s-1MTA,\s0 not by SpamAssassin.
.Sp
In case of an IPv4 address in brackets, it may be truncated on classful
boundaries to cover whole subnets, e.g. \f(CW\*(C`[10.1.2.3]\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`[10.1.2]\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`[10.1]\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`[10]\*(C'\fR.  \s-1CIDR\s0 notation is currently not supported, nor is
IPv6. The matching on \s-1IP\s0 address is mainly provided to cover rare cases
where whitelisting of a sending \s-1MTA\s0 is desired which does not have a
correct reverse \s-1DNS\s0 configured.
.Sp
In other words, if the host that connected to your \s-1MX\s0 had an \s-1IP\s0 address
192.0.2.123 that mapped to 'sendinghost.example.org', you should specify
\&\f(CW\*(C`sendinghost.example.org\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`example.org\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`[192.0.2.123]\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`[192.0.2]\*(C'\fR here.
.Sp
Note that this requires that \f(CW\*(C`internal_networks\*(C'\fR be correct.  For simple
cases, it will be, but for a complex network you may get better results
by setting that parameter.
.Sp
It also requires that your mail exchangers be configured to perform \s-1DNS\s0
reverse lookups on the connecting host's \s-1IP\s0 address, and to record the
result in the generated Received header field according to \s-1RFC 5321.\s0

Same as \f(CW\*(C`whitelist_from_rcvd\*(C'\fR, but used for the default whitelist entries
in the SpamAssassin distribution.  The whitelist score is lower, because
these are often targets for spammer spoofing.
.IP "whitelist_allows_relays user@example.com" 4
.IX Item "whitelist_allows_relays user@example.com"
Specify addresses which are in \f(CW\*(C`whitelist_from_rcvd\*(C'\fR that sometimes
send through a mail relay other than the listed ones. By default mail
with a From address that is in \f(CW\*(C`whitelist_from_rcvd\*(C'\fR that does not match
the relay will trigger a forgery rule. Including the address in
\&\f(CW\*(C`whitelist_allows_relay\*(C'\fR prevents that.
.Sp
Whitelist and blacklist addresses are now file-glob-style patterns, so
\&\f(CW\*(C`friend@somewhere.com\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`*@isp.com\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`*.domain.net\*(C'\fR will all work.
Specifically, \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`?\*(C'\fR are allowed, but all other metacharacters

\&\f(CW\*(C`whitelist_allows_relays\*(C'\fR lines are also \s-1OK.\s0

previously used in a whitelist_from_rcvd line as it is compared to the
address in the header.

.IX Item "whitelist_to user@example.com"
If the given address appears as a recipient in the message headers
(Resent-To, To, Cc, obvious envelope recipient, etc.) the mail will
be whitelisted.  Useful if you're deploying SpamAssassin system-wide,
and don't want some users to have their mail filtered.  Same format
as \f(CW\*(C`whitelist_from\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
There are three levels of To-whitelisting, \f(CW\*(C`whitelist_to\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`more_spam_to\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`all_spam_to\*(C'\fR.  Users in the first level may still get some spammish
mails blocked, but users in \f(CW\*(C`all_spam_to\*(C'\fR should never get mail blocked.
.Sp
The headers checked for whitelist addresses are as follows: if \f(CW\*(C`Resent\-To\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`Resent\-Cc\*(C'\fR are set, use those; otherwise check all addresses taken from the

.IP "whitelist_auth user@example.com" 4
.IX Item "whitelist_auth user@example.com"
Used to specify addresses which send mail that is often tagged (incorrectly) as
spam.  This is different from \f(CW\*(C`whitelist_from\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`whitelist_from_rcvd\*(C'\fR in
that it first verifies that the message was sent by an authorized sender for
the address, before whitelisting.
.Sp
Authorization is performed using one of the installed sender-authorization
schemes: \s-1SPF \s0(using \f(CW\*(C`Mail::SpamAssassin::Plugin::SPF\*(C'\fR), or \s-1DKIM \s0(using
\&\f(CW\*(C`Mail::SpamAssassin::Plugin::DKIM\*(C'\fR).  Note that those plugins must be active,
and working, for this to operate.
.Sp
Using \f(CW\*(C`whitelist_auth\*(C'\fR is roughly equivalent to specifying duplicate
\&\f(CW\*(C`whitelist_from_spf\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`whitelist_from_dk\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`whitelist_from_dkim\*(C'\fR lines

.IP "enlist_uri_host (listname) host ..." 4
.IX Item "enlist_uri_host (listname) host ..."
Adds one or more host names or domain names to a named list of \s-1URI\s0 domains.
The named list can then be consulted through a \fIcheck_uri_host_listed()\fR
eval rule implemented by the WLBLEval plugin, which takes the list name as
an argument. Parenthesis around a list name are literal \- a required syntax.
.Sp
Host names may optionally be prefixed by an exclamantion mark '!', which
produces false as a result if this entry matches. This makes it easier
to exclude some subdomains when their superdomain is listed, for example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  enlist_uri_host (MYLIST) !sub1.example.com !sub2.example.com example.com
.Ve
.Sp
No wildcards are supported, but subdomains do match implicitly. Lists

full hostname first, then leading fields are progressively stripped off
(e.g.: sub.example.com, example.com, com) until a match is found or we run

this will be prepended to the original subject. Note that you should
only use the _REQD_ and _SCORE_ tags when rewriting the Subject header

if this option is set to 1, if an incoming message is tagged as spam,
instead of modifying the original message, SpamAssassin will create a

easily opened, and easier to recover).
.Sp
If this option is set to 2, then original messages will be attached with
a content type of text/plain instead of message/rfc822.  This setting
may be required for safety reasons on certain broken mail clients that
automatically load attachments without any action by the user.  This
setting may also make it somewhat more difficult to extract or view the
original message.

set used for attempted decoding is primarily based on a declared character
set in a Content-Type header, but if the decoding attempt fails a module
Encode::Detect::Detector is consulted (if available) to provide a guess
based on the actual text, and decoding is re-attempted. Even if the option
is enabled no unnecessary decoding and re-encoding work is done when
possible (like with an all-ASCII text with a US-ASCII or extended \s-1ASCII\s0

What networks or hosts are 'trusted' in your setup.  \fBTrusted\fR in this case
means that relay hosts on these networks are considered to not be potentially
operated by spammers, open relays, or open proxies.  A trusted host could
conceivably relay spam, but will not originate it, and will not forge header
data. \s-1DNS\s0 blacklist checks will never query for hosts on these networks.
.Sp
See \f(CW\*(C`http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/TrustPath\*(C'\fR for more information.
.Sp
MXes for your domain(s) and internal relays should \fBalso\fR be specified using
the \f(CW\*(C`internal_networks\*(C'\fR setting. When there are 'trusted' hosts that
are not MXes or internal relays for your domain(s) they should \fBonly\fR be
specified in \f(CW\*(C`trusted_networks\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`IPaddress\*(C'\fR can be an IPv4 address (in a dot-quad form), or an IPv6
address optionally enclosed in square brackets. Scoped link-local IPv6
addresses are syntactically recognized but the interface scope is currently
ignored (e.g. [fe80::1234%eth0] ) and should be avoided.
.Sp
If a \f(CW\*(C`/masklen\*(C'\fR is specified, it is considered a CIDR-style 'netmask' length,
specified in bits.  If it is not specified, but less than 4 octets of an IPv4
address are specified with a trailing dot, an implied netmask length covers
all addresses in remaining octets (i.e. implied masklen is /8 or /16 or /24).
If masklen is not specified, and there is not trailing dot, then just a single
\&\s-1IP\s0 address specified is used, as if the masklen were \f(CW\*(C`/32\*(C'\fR with an IPv4
address, or \f(CW\*(C`/128\*(C'\fR in case of an IPv6 address.
.Sp
If a network or host address is prefaced by a \f(CW\*(C`!\*(C'\fR the matching network or
host will be excluded from the list even if a less specific (shorter netmask
length) subnet is later specified in the list. This allows a subset of
a wider network to be exempt. In case of specifying overlapping subnets,
specify more specific subnets first (tighter matching, i.e. with a longer
netmask length), followed by less specific (shorter netmask length) subnets
to get predictable results regarless of the search algorithm used \- when
Net::Patricia module is installed the search finds the tightest matching
entry in the list, while a sequential search as used in absence of the
module Net::Patricia will find the first matching entry in the list.

\&\fB\s-1MSA\s0\fR means that the relay hosts on these networks accept mail from your

.Sp
For example, if the \s-1MSA\s0 relay is trusted and internal so will all of the

When using msa_networks to identify an \s-1MSA\s0 it is recommended that you treat

\&\s-1DNS\s0 tests, which can be slow or unreliable.
.Sp
When the option value is a \fItest\fR (with or without arguments), SpamAssassin
will query some domain names on the internet during initialization, attempting
to determine if \s-1DNS\s0 resolving is working or not. A space-separated list
of domain names may be specified explicitly, or left to a built-in default
of a dozen or so domain names. From an explicit or a default list a subset
of three domain names is picked randomly for checking. The test queries for
\&\s-1NS\s0 records of these domain: if at least one query returns a success then
SpamAssassin considers \s-1DNS\s0 resolving as available, otherwise not.
.Sp
The problem is that the test can introduce some startup delay if a network
connection is down, and in some cases it can wrongly guess that \s-1DNS\s0 is
unavailable because a test connection failed, what causes disabling several
DNS-dependent tests.

The initial set consists of all port numbers in the range 1024\-65535.

.IX Item "dns_options opts (default: norotate, nodns0x20, edns=4096)"
Provides a (whitespace or comma \-separated) list of options applying
to \s-1DNS\s0 resolving. Available options are: \fIrotate\fR, \fIdns0x20\fR and
\&\fIedns\fR (or \fIedns0\fR). Option name may be negated by prepending a \fIno\fR
(e.g. \fInorotate\fR, \fINoEDNS\fR) to counteract a previously enabled option.
Option names are not case-sensitive. The \fIdns_options\fR directive may
appear in configuration files multiple times, the last setting prevails.
.Sp
Option \fIedns\fR (or \fIedsn0\fR) may take a value which specifies a requestor's
acceptable \s-1UDP\s0 payload size according to \s-1EDNS0\s0 specifications (\s-1RFC 6891,\s0
ex \s-1RFC 2671\s0) e.g. \fIedns=4096\fR. When \s-1EDNS0\s0 is off (\fInoedns\fR or \fIedns=512\fR)
a traditional implied \s-1UDP\s0 payload size is 512 bytes, which is also a minimum
allowed value for this option. When the option is specified but a value
is not provided, a conservative default of 1220 bytes is implied. It is
recommended to keep \fIedns\fR enabled when using a local recursive \s-1DNS\s0 server
which supports \s-1EDNS0 \s0(like most modern \s-1DNS\s0 servers do), a suitable setting
in this case is \fIedns=4096\fR, which is also a default. Allowing \s-1UDP\s0 payload
size larger than 512 bytes can avoid truncation of resource records in large
\&\s-1DNS\s0 responses (like in \s-1TXT\s0 records of some \s-1SPF\s0 and \s-1DKIM\s0 responses, or when
an unreasonable number of A records is published by some domain). The option
should be disabled when a recursive \s-1DNS\s0 server is only reachable through
non\- \s-1RFC 6891\s0 compliant middleboxes (such as some old-fashioned firewall)
which bans \s-1DNS UDP\s0 payload sizes larger than 512 bytes. A suitable value
when a non-local recursive \s-1DNS\s0 server is used and a middlebox \fBdoes\fR allow
\&\s-1EDNS0\s0 but blocks fragmented \s-1IP\s0 packets is perhaps 1220 bytes, allowing a
\&\s-1DNS UDP\s0 packet to fit within a single \s-1IP\s0 packet in most cases (a slightly
less conservative range would be 1280\-1410 bytes).
.Sp
Option \fIrotate\fR causes SpamAssassin to choose a \s-1DNS\s0 server at random
from all servers listed in \f(CW\*(C`/etc/resolv.conf\*(C'\fR every \fIdns_test_interval\fR
seconds, effectively spreading the load over all currently available \s-1DNS\s0
servers when there are many spamd workers.
.Sp
Option \fIdns0x20\fR enables randomization of letters in a \s-1DNS\s0 query label
according to draft\-vixie\-dnsext\-dns0x20, decreasing a chance of collisions
of responses (by chance or by a malicious intent) by increasing spread
as provided by a 16\-bit query \s-1ID\s0 and up to 16 bits of a port number,
with additional bits as encoded by flipping case (upper/lower) of letters
in a query. The number of additional random bits corresponds to the number
of letters in a query label. Should work reliably with all mainstream
\&\s-1DNS\s0 servers \- do not turn on if you see frequent info messages
\&\*(L"dns: no callback for id:\*(R" in the log, or if \s-1RBL\s0 or \s-1URIDNS\s0 lookups
do not work for no apparent reason.
.IP "dns_query_restriction (allow|deny) domain1 domain2 ..." 4
.IX Item "dns_query_restriction (allow|deny) domain1 domain2 ..."
Option allows disabling of rules which would result in a \s-1DNS\s0 query to one of
the listed domains. The first argument must be a literal \f(CW\*(C`allow\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`deny\*(C'\fR,
remaining arguments are domains names.
.Sp
Most \s-1DNS\s0 queries (with some exceptions) are subject to dns_query_restriction.
A domain to be queried is successively stripped-off of its leading labels
(thus yielding a series of its parent domains), and on each iteration a
check is made against an associative array generated by dns_query_restriction
options. Search stops at the first match (i.e. the tightest match), and the
matching entry with its \f(CW\*(C`allow\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`deny\*(C'\fR value then controls whether a
\&\s-1DNS\s0 query is allowed to be launched.
.Sp
If no match is found an implicit default is to allow a query. The purpose of
an explicit \f(CW\*(C`allow\*(C'\fR entry is to be able to override a previously configured
\&\f(CW\*(C`deny\*(C'\fR on the same domain or to override an entry (possibly yet to be
configured in subsequent config directives) on one of its parent domains.
Thus an 'allow zen.spamhaus.org' with a 'deny spamhaus.org' would permit
\&\s-1DNS\s0 queries on a specific \s-1DNS BL\s0 zone but deny queries to other zones under
the same parent domain.
.Sp
Domains are matched case-insensitively, no wildcards are recognized,
there should be no leading or trailing dot.
.Sp
Specifying a block on querying a domain name has a similar effect as setting
a score of corresponding \s-1DNSBL\s0 and \s-1URIBL\s0 rules to zero, and can be a handy
alternative to hunting for such rules when a site policy does not allow
certain \s-1DNS\s0 block lists to be queried.
.Sp

  dns_query_restriction deny  dnswl.org surbl.org
  dns_query_restriction allow zen.spamhaus.org
  dns_query_restriction deny  spamhaus.org mailspike.net spamcop.net

Controls which sources in a mail message can contribute tokens (e.g. words,

of keywords: \fIheader\fR, \fIvisible\fR, \fIinvisible\fR, \fIuri\fR, \fImimepart\fR), each
of which may be prefixed by a \fIno\fR to indicate its exclusion. Additionally
two reserved keywords are allowed: \fIall\fR and \fInone\fR (or: \fInoall\fR). The list
of keywords is processed sequentially: a keyword \fIall\fR adds all available
keywords to a set being built, a \fInone\fR or \fInoall\fR clears the set, other
non-negated keywords are added to the set, and negated keywords are removed
from the set. Keywords are case-insensitive.
.Sp
The default set is: \fIheader\fR \fIvisible\fR \fIinvisible\fR \fIuri\fR, which is
equivalent for example to: \fIAll\fR \fINoMIMEpart\fR. The reason why \fImimepart\fR
is not currently in a default set is that it is a newer source (introduced
with SpamAssassin version 3.4.1) and not much experience has yet been gathered
regarding its usefulness.

equivalent to a 8Mb database file.
.IP "bayes_auto_expire       		(default: 1)" 4
.IX Item "bayes_auto_expire (default: 1)"
If enabled, the Bayes system will try to automatically expire old tokens

.Sp
If bayes_auto_expire is true and a Bayes datastore backend supports it

.IX Item "bayes_learn_to_journal (default: 0)"
If this option is set, whenever SpamAssassin does Bayes learning, it

database.  This lowers contention for locking the database to execute
an update, but will also cause more access to the journal and cause a
delay before the updates are actually committed to the Bayes database.
.SS "\s-1MISCELLANEOUS OPTIONS\s0"
.IX Subsection "MISCELLANEOUS OPTIONS"
.IP "time_limit n   (default: 300)" 4
.IX Item "time_limit n (default: 300)"
Specifies a limit on elapsed time in seconds that SpamAssassin is allowed
to spend before providing a result. The value may be fractional and must
not be negative, zero is interpreted as unlimited. The default is 300
seconds for consistency with the spamd default setting of \-\-timeout\-child .
.Sp
This is a best-effort advisory setting, processing will not be abruptly
aborted at an arbitrary point in processing when the time limit is exceeded,
but only on reaching one of locations in the program flow equipped with a
time test. Currently equipped with the test are the main checking loop,
asynchronous \s-1DNS\s0 lookups, plugins which are calling external programs.
Rule evaluation is guarded by starting a timer (alarm) on each set of
compiled rules.
.Sp
When a message is passed to Mail::SpamAssassin::parse, a deadline time
is established as a sum of current time and the \f(CW\*(C`time_limit\*(C'\fR setting.
.Sp
This deadline may also be specified by a caller through an option
\&'master_deadline' in \f(CW$suppl_attrib\fR on a call to \fIparse()\fR, possibly providing
a more accurate deadline taking into account past and expected future
processing of a message in a mail filtering setup. If both the config
option as well as a 'master_deadline' option in a call are provided,
the shorter time limit of the two is used (since version 3.3.2).
Note that spamd (and possibly third-party callers of SpamAssassin) will
supply the 'master_deadline' option in a call based on its \-\-timeout\-child
option (or equivalent), unlike the command line \f(CW\*(C`spamassassin\*(C'\fR, which has
no such command line option.
.Sp
When a time limit is exceeded, most of the remaining tests will be skipped,
as well as auto-learning. Whatever tests fired so far will determine the
final score. The behaviour is similar to short-circuiting with attribute 'on',
as implemented by a Shortcircuit plugin. A synthetic hit on a rule named
\&\s-1TIME_LIMIT_EXCEEDED\s0 with a near-zero default score is generated, so that
the report will reflect the event. A score for \s-1TIME_LIMIT_EXCEEDED\s0 may
be provided explicitly in a configuration file, for example to achieve
whitelisting or blacklisting effect for messages with long processing times.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`time_limit\*(C'\fR option is a useful protection against excessive processing
time on certain degenerate or unusually long or complex mail messages, as well
as against some DoS attacks. It is also needed in time-critical pre-queue
filtering setups (e.g. milter, proxy, integration with \s-1MTA\s0), where message
processing must finish before a \s-1SMTP\s0 client times out.  \s-1RFC 5321\s0 prescribes
in section 4.5.3.2.6 the '\s-1DATA\s0 Termination' time limit of 10 minutes,
although it is not unusual to see some \s-1SMTP\s0 clients abort sooner on waiting
for a response. A sensible \f(CW\*(C`time_limit\*(C'\fR for a pre-queue filtering setup is
maybe 50 seconds, assuming that clients are willing to wait at least a minute.
.IP "lock_method type" 4

default, SpamAssassin uses an NFS-safe locking method on \s-1UNIX\s0; however, if you

never be accessed over \s-1NFS,\s0 a non-NFS-safe locking system can be selected.

SpamAssassin will attempt to discover the address used in the '\s-1MAIL FROM:\s0'

been made available by the \s-1SMTP\s0 server.  This is used in the \f(CW\*(C`EnvelopeFrom\*(C'\fR

.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    X\-Envelope\-From

\&    X\-Sender
\&    Return\-Path
.Ve
.Sp
SpamAssassin will attempt to use these, if some heuristics (such as the header
placement in the message, or the absence of fetchmail signatures) appear to
indicate that they are safe to use.  However, it may choose the wrong headers
in some mailserver configurations.  (More discussion of this can be found
in bug 2142 and bug 4747 in the SpamAssassin BugZilla.)
.Sp
To avoid this heuristic failure, the \f(CW\*(C`envelope_sender_header\*(C'\fR setting may be
helpful.  Name the header that your \s-1MTA\s0 or \s-1MDA\s0 adds to messages containing the
address used at the \s-1MAIL FROM\s0 step of the \s-1SMTP\s0 transaction.
.Sp

then, they may only add rules from below).
.IP "allow_user_rules ( 0 | 1 )		(default: 0)" 4
.IX Item "allow_user_rules ( 0 | 1 ) (default: 0)"
This setting allows users to create rules (and only rules) in their

this could be a severe security hole. It may be possible for users to
gain root level access if \f(CW\*(C`spamd\*(C'\fR is run as root. It is \s-1NOT\s0 a good
idea, unless you have some other way of ensuring that users' tests are
safe. Don't use this unless you are certain you know what you are
doing. Furthermore, this option causes spamassassin to recompile all
the tests each time it processes a message for a user with a rule in
his/her \f(CW\*(C`user_prefs\*(C'\fR file, which could have a significant effect on
server load. It is not recommended.

.IX Item "header SYMBOLIC_TEST_NAME header op /pattern/modifiers [if-unset: STRING]"
Define a test.  \f(CW\*(C`SYMBOLIC_TEST_NAME\*(C'\fR is a symbolic test name, such as
\&'\s-1FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS\s0'.  \f(CW\*(C`header\*(C'\fR is the name of a mail header field,
such as 'Subject', 'To', 'From', etc.  Header field names are matched
case-insensitively (conforming to \s-1RFC 5322\s0 section 1.2.2), except for
all-capitals metaheader fields such as \s-1ALL, MESSAGEID,\s0 ALL-TRUSTED.
.Sp
Appending a modifier \f(CW\*(C`:raw\*(C'\fR to a header field name will inhibit decoding of
quoted-printable or base\-64 encoded strings, and will preserve all whitespace
inside the header string.  The \f(CW\*(C`:raw\*(C'\fR may also be applied to pseudo-headers
e.g. \f(CW\*(C`ALL:raw\*(C'\fR will return a pristine (unmodified) header section.
.Sp
Appending a modifier \f(CW\*(C`:addr\*(C'\fR to a header field name will cause everything
except the first email address to be removed from the header field.  It is
mainly applicable to header fields 'From', 'Sender', 'To', 'Cc' along with
their 'Resent\-*' counterparts, and the 'Return\-Path'.
.Sp
Appending a modifier \f(CW\*(C`:name\*(C'\fR to a header field name will cause everything
except the first display name to be removed from the header field. It is
mainly applicable to header fields containing a single mail address: 'From',
\&'Sender', along with their 'Resent\-From' and 'Resent\-Sender' counterparts.
.Sp
It is syntactically permitted to append more than one modifier to a header
field name, although currently most combinations achieve no additional effect,
for example \f(CW\*(C`From:addr:raw\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`From:raw:addr\*(C'\fR is currently the same as
\&\f(CW\*(C`From:addr\*(C'\fR .

For example, appending \f(CW\*(C`:addr\*(C'\fR to a header name will result in example@foo
in all of the following cases:

This is accomplished by placing '\-notfirsthop' at the end of the set name.
This is useful for querying against \s-1DNS\s0 lists which list dialup \s-1IP\s0
addresses; the first hop may be a dialup, but as long as there is at least
one more hop, via their outgoing \s-1SMTP\s0 server, that's legitimate, and so
should not gain points.  If there is only one hop, that will be queried
anyway, as it should be relaying via its outgoing \s-1SMTP\s0 server instead of
sending directly to your \s-1MX \s0(mail exchange).
.IP "selecting IPs by whether they are trusted" 4
.IX Item "selecting IPs by whether they are trusted"
When checking a 'nice' \s-1DNSBL \s0(a \s-1DNS\s0 whitelist), you cannot trust the \s-1IP\s0
addresses in Received headers that were not added by trusted relays.  To
test the first \s-1IP\s0 address that can be trusted, place '\-firsttrusted' at the
end of the set name.  That should test the \s-1IP\s0 address of the relay that
connected to the most remote trusted relay.
.Sp
Note that this requires that SpamAssassin know which relays are trusted.  For
simple cases, SpamAssassin can make a good estimate.  For complex cases, you
may get better results by setting \f(CW\*(C`trusted_networks\*(C'\fR manually.
.Sp
In addition, you can test all untrusted \s-1IP\s0 addresses by placing '\-untrusted'
at the end of the set name.   Important note \*(-- this does \s-1NOT\s0 include the 
\&\s-1IP\s0 address from the most recent 'untrusted line', as used in '\-firsttrusted'
above.  That's because we're talking about the trustworthiness of the
\&\s-1IP\s0 address data, not the source header line, here; and in the case of

.IP "meta \s-1SYMBOLIC_TEST_NAME\s0 boolean arithmetic expression" 4
.IX Item "meta SYMBOLIC_TEST_NAME boolean arithmetic expression"
Can also define an arithmetic expression in terms of other tests,
with an unhit test having the value \*(L"0\*(R" and a hit test having a
nonzero value.  The value of a hit meta test is that of its arithmetic
expression.  The value of a hit eval test is that returned by its
method.  The value of a hit header, body, rawbody, uri, or full test
which has the \*(L"multiple\*(R" tflag is the number of times the test hit.
The value of any other type of hit test is \*(L"1\*(R".
.Sp
For example:
.Sp
meta \s-1META2        \s0(3 * \s-1TEST1 \- 2\s0 * \s-1TEST2\s0) > 0
.Sp
Note that Perl builtins and functions, like \f(CW\*(C`abs()\*(C'\fR, \fBcan't\fR be
used, and will be treated as rule names.
.Sp
If you want to define a meta-rule, but do not want its individual sub-rules to
count towards the final score unless the entire meta-rule matches, give the
sub-rules names that start with '_\|_' (two underscores).  SpamAssassin will
ignore these for scoring.

Defines the name of a test that should be \*(L"reused\*(R" during the scoring
process. If a message has an X\-Spam-Status header that shows a hit for
this rule or any of the old rule names given, a hit will be added for
this rule when \fBmass-check \-\-reuse\fR is used. Examples:

.IP "tflags \s-1SYMBOLIC_TEST_NAME\s0 flags" 4
.IX Item "tflags SYMBOLIC_TEST_NAME flags"
Used to set flags on a test. Parameter is a space-separated list of flag
names or flag name = value pairs.
These flags are used in the score-determination back end system for details
of the test's behaviour.  Please see \f(CW\*(C`bayes_auto_learn\*(C'\fR for more information
about tflag interaction with those systems. The following flags can be set:
.RS 4
.IP "net" 4
.IX Item "net"
The test is a network test, and will not be run in the mass checking system
or if \fB\-L\fR is used, therefore its score should not be modified.
.IP "nice" 4
.IX Item "nice"
The test is intended to compensate for common false positives, and should be
assigned a negative score.
.IP "userconf" 4
.IX Item "userconf"
The test requires user configuration before it can be used (like
language-specific tests).
.IP "learn" 4
.IX Item "learn"
The test requires training before it can be used.
.IP "noautolearn" 4
.IX Item "noautolearn"
The test will explicitly be ignored when calculating the score for
learning systems.
.IP "autolearn_force" 4
.IX Item "autolearn_force"
The test will be subject to less stringent autolearn thresholds.
.Sp
Normally, SpamAssassin will require 3 points from the header and 3
points from the body to be auto-learned as spam. This option keeps
the threshold at 6 points total but changes it to have no regard to the 
source of the points.
.IP "noawl" 4
.IX Item "noawl"
This flag is specific when using \s-1AWL\s0 plugin.
.Sp
Normally, \s-1AWL\s0 plugin normalizes scores via auto-whitelist. In some scenarios
it works against the system administrator when trying to add some rules to
correct miss-classified email. When \s-1AWL\s0 plugin searches the email and finds 
the noawl flag it will exit without normalizing the score nor storing the
value in db.
.IP "multiple" 4
.IX Item "multiple"
The test will be evaluated multiple times, for use with meta rules.
Only affects header, body, rawbody, uri, and full tests.
.IP "maxhits=N" 4
.IX Item "maxhits=N"
If \fBmultiple\fR is specified, limit the number of hits found to N.
If the rule is used in a meta that counts the hits (e.g. _\|_RULENAME > 5),
this is a way to avoid wasted extra work (use \*(L"tflags multiple maxhits=6\*(R").

.IP "rbl_timeout t [t_min] [zone]		(default: 15 3)" 4
.IX Item "rbl_timeout t [t_min] [zone] (default: 15 3)"
All \s-1DNS\s0 queries are made at the beginning of a check and we try to read
the results at the end.  This value specifies the maximum period of time
(in seconds) to wait for a \s-1DNS\s0 query.  If most of the \s-1DNS\s0 queries have
succeeded for a particular message, then SpamAssassin will not wait for
the full period to avoid wasting time on unresponsive server(s), but will
shrink the timeout according to a percentage of queries already completed.
As the number of queries remaining approaches 0, the timeout value will
gradually approach a t_min value, which is an optional second parameter
and defaults to 0.2 * t.  If t is smaller than t_min, the initial timeout
is set to t_min.  Here is a chart of queries remaining versus the timeout
in seconds, for the default 15 second / 3 second timeout setting:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  queries left  100%  90%  80%  70%  60%  50%  40%  30%  20%  10%   0%
\&  timeout        15   14.9 14.5 13.9 13.1 12.0 10.7  9.1  7.3  5.3  3
.Ve
.Sp
For example, if 20 queries are made at the beginning of a message check
and 16 queries have returned (leaving 20%), the remaining 4 queries should
finish within 7.3 seconds since their query started or they will be timed out.
Note that timed out queries are only aborted when there is nothing else left
for SpamAssassin to do \- long evaluation of other rules may grant queries
additional time.
.Sp
If a parameter 'zone' is specified (it must end with a letter, which
distinguishes it from other numeric parametrs), then the setting only
applies to \s-1DNS\s0 queries against the specified \s-1DNS\s0 domain (host, domain or
\&\s-1RBL \s0(sub)zone).  Matching is case-insensitive, the actual domain may be a
subdomain of the specified zone.

The \f(CW\*(C`HAMMYTOKENS\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`SPAMMYTOKENS\*(C'\fR tags have an optional second argument
which specifies a format.  See the \fB\s-1HAMMYTOKENS/SPAMMYTOKENS TAG FORMAT\s0\fR
section, below, for details.
.SS "\s-1HAMMYTOKENS/SPAMMYTOKENS TAG FORMAT\s0"
.IX Subsection "HAMMYTOKENS/SPAMMYTOKENS TAG FORMAT"
The \f(CW\*(C`HAMMYTOKENS\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`SPAMMYTOKENS\*(C'\fR tags have an optional second argument
which specifies a format: \f(CW\*(C`_SPAMMYTOKENS(N,FMT)_\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`_HAMMYTOKENS(N,FMT)_\*(C'\fR
The following formats are available:
.IP "short" 4
.IX Item "short"
Only the tokens themselves are listed.
\&\fIFor example, preference file entry:\fR
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`add_header all Spammy _SPAMMYTOKENS(2,short)_\*(C'\fR
.Sp
\&\fIResults in message header:\fR
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`X\-Spam\-Spammy: remove.php, UD:jpg\*(C'\fR
.Sp
Indicating that the top two spammy tokens found are \f(CW\*(C`remove.php\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`UD:jpg\*(C'\fR.  (The token itself follows the last colon, the
text before the colon indicates something about the token.
\&\f(CW\*(C`UD\*(C'\fR means the token looks like it might be part of a domain name.)
.IP "compact" 4
.IX Item "compact"
The token probability, an abbreviated declassification distance (see
example), and the token are listed.
\&\fIFor example, preference file entry:\fR
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`add_header all Spammy _SPAMMYTOKENS(2,compact)_\*(C'\fR
.Sp
\&\fIResults in message header:\fR
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`0.989\-6\-\-remove.php, 0.988\-+\-\-UD:jpg\*(C'\fR
.Sp
Indicating that the probabilities of the top two tokens are 0.989 and
0.988, respectively.  The first token has a declassification distance
of 6, meaning that if the token had appeared in at least 6 more ham
messages it would not be considered spammy.  The \f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR for the second
token indicates a declassification distance greater than 9.
.IP "long" 4
.IX Item "long"
Probability, declassification distance, number of times seen in a ham
message, number of times seen in a spam message, age and the token are
listed.
.Sp
\&\fIFor example, preference file entry:\fR
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`add_header all Spammy _SPAMMYTOKENS(2,long)_\*(C'\fR
.Sp
\&\fIResults in message header:\fR
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`X\-Spam\-Spammy: 0.989\-6\-\-0h\-4s\-\-4d\-\-remove.php, 0.988\-33\-\-2h\-25s\-\-1d\-\-UD:jpg\*(C'\fR
.Sp
In addition to the information provided by the compact option,
the long option shows that the first token appeared in zero
ham messages and four spam messages, and that it was last
seen four days ago.  The second token appeared in two ham messages,
25 spam messages and was last seen one day ago.
(Unlike the \f(CW\*(C`compact\*(C'\fR option, the long option shows declassification
distances that are greater than 9.)
.SH "LOCALI[SZ]ATION"
.IX Header "LOCALI[SZ]ATION"
A line starting with the text \f(CW\*(C`lang xx\*(C'\fR will only be interpreted
if the user is in that locale, allowing test descriptions and
templates to be set for that language.
.PP
The locales string should specify either both the language and country, e.g.
\&\f(CW\*(C`lang pt_BR\*(C'\fR, or just the language, e.g. \f(CW\*(C`lang de\*(C'\fR.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
