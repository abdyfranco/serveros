Mailbox settings
================

Since Dovecot v2.1 one can assign SPECIAL-USE RFC 6154
[http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc6154.html] tags and specify, which mailboxes to
create and/or subscribe to automatically.

The autocreated mailboxes are created lazily to disk only when accessed for the
first time. The autosubscribed mailboxes aren't written to subscriptions file,
unless SUBSCRIBE command is explicitly used for them.

The mailbox section name specifies the mailbox name. If it has spaces, you can
put it in "quotes". The mailbox settings are:

 * auto: Autocreate/subscribe mailbox?
    * no: Neither
    * create: Autocreate, but don't autosubscribe
    * subscribe: Autocreate and autosubscribe
 * special_use: Space-separated list of SPECIAL-USE flags to use for the
   mailbox. There are no validity checks, so you could specify anything you
   want in here, but it's not a good idea to use other than the standard ones
   specified in the RFC.
 * autoexpunge=<time>: (v2.2.20+) Automatically at user deinitialization
   expunge all mails in this mailbox whose saved-timestamp is older than<time>
   (e.g. autoexpunge=30d). This removes the need for <expire plugin>
   [Plugins.Expire.txt] if you don't care that the expunging may not always
   happen in time.
    * For IMAP and POP3 this happens after the client is already disconnected.
    * For LMTP this happens when the user's mail delivery is finished. Note
      that if there are multiple recipients this may delay delivering the mails
      to the other recipients.
    * Also doveadm and other processes verify this, which may be unnecessary.
      So it may be better to explicitly enable this only inside protocol imap,
      pop3 and maybe lmtp. You can do this with e.g.:'protocol imap { namespace
      inbox { mailbox Spam { autoexpunge = 10d } } }'
    * mailbox_list_index=yes is highly recommended when using this setting, as
      it avoids actually opening the mailbox to see if anything needs to be
      expunged.
