Autocreate plugin (v2.0 and older)
==================================

With v2.1+ you don't need this plugin. Use <mailbox { auto } setting>
[MailboxSettings.txt] instead.

This plugin allows administrator to specify mailboxes that must always exist
for all users. They can optionally also be subscribed. The mailboxes are
created and subscribed always after user logs in. Namespaces are fully
supported, so namespace prefixes need to be used where necessary.

Example:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
protocol imap {
  mail_plugins = $mail_plugins autocreate
}
plugin {
  autocreate = Trash
  autocreate2 = Spam
  #autocreate3 = ..etc..
  autosubscribe = Trash
  autosubscribe2 = Spam
  #autosubscribe3 = ..etc..
}
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
