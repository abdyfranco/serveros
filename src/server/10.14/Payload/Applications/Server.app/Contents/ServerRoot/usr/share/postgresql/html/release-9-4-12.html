>      The initial snapshot created for a logical decoding replication slot
      was potentially incorrect.  This could cause third-party tools that
      use logical decoding to copy incomplete/inconsistent initial data.
      This was more likely to happen if the source server was busy at the
      time of slot creation, or if another logical slot already existed.

      This resulted in the timezone code falling back to its built-in
      rule about what DST behavior to assume for a POSIX-style time zone
      name.  For historical reasons that still corresponds to the DST rules
      the USA was using before 2007 (i.e., change on first Sunday in April
      and last Sunday in October).  With this fix, a POSIX-style zone name
      will use the current and historical DST transition dates of
      the <TT

      due to caching, you may need to restart the server to get such changes
