.SH "NAME"
pg_config \- retrieve information about the installed version of PostgreSQL
.\" pg_config
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBpg_config\fR\ 'u
\fBpg_config\fR [\fIoption\fR...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
pg_config
utility prints configuration parameters of the currently installed version of
PostgreSQL\&. It is intended, for example, to be used by software packages that want to interface to
PostgreSQL
to facilitate finding the required header files and libraries\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
To use
pg_config, supply one or more of the following options:
.PP
\fB\-\-bindir\fR
.RS 4
Print the location of user executables\&. Use this, for example, to find the
\fBpsql\fR
program\&. This is normally also the location where the
pg_config
program resides\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-docdir\fR
.RS 4
Print the location of documentation files\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-htmldir\fR
.RS 4
Print the location of HTML documentation files\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-includedir\fR
.RS 4
Print the location of C header files of the client interfaces\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-pkgincludedir\fR
.RS 4
Print the location of other C header files\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-includedir\-server\fR
.RS 4
Print the location of C header files for server programming\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-libdir\fR
.RS 4
Print the location of object code libraries\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-pkglibdir\fR
.RS 4
Print the location of dynamically loadable modules, or where the server would search for them\&. (Other architecture\-dependent data files might also be installed in this directory\&.)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-localedir\fR
.RS 4
Print the location of locale support files\&. (This will be an empty string if locale support was not configured when
PostgreSQL
was built\&.)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-mandir\fR
.RS 4
Print the location of manual pages\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-sharedir\fR
.RS 4
Print the location of architecture\-independent support files\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-sysconfdir\fR
.RS 4
Print the location of system\-wide configuration files\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-pgxs\fR
.RS 4
Print the location of extension makefiles\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-configure\fR
.RS 4
Print the options that were given to the
configure
script when
PostgreSQL
was configured for building\&. This can be used to reproduce the identical configuration, or to find out with what options a binary package was built\&. (Note however that binary packages often contain vendor\-specific custom patches\&.) See also the examples below\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-cc\fR
.RS 4
Print the value of the
\fICC\fR
variable that was used for building
PostgreSQL\&. This shows the C compiler used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-cppflags\fR
.RS 4
Print the value of the
\fICPPFLAGS\fR
variable that was used for building
PostgreSQL\&. This shows C compiler switches needed at preprocessing time (typically,
\-I
switches)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-cflags\fR
.RS 4
Print the value of the
\fICFLAGS\fR
variable that was used for building
PostgreSQL\&. This shows C compiler switches\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-cflags_sl\fR
.RS 4
Print the value of the
\fICFLAGS_SL\fR
variable that was used for building
PostgreSQL\&. This shows extra C compiler switches used for building shared libraries\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ldflags\fR
.RS 4
Print the value of the
\fILDFLAGS\fR
variable that was used for building
PostgreSQL\&. This shows linker switches\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ldflags_ex\fR
.RS 4
Print the value of the
\fILDFLAGS_EX\fR
variable that was used for building
PostgreSQL\&. This shows linker switches used for building executables only\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ldflags_sl\fR
.RS 4
Print the value of the
\fILDFLAGS_SL\fR
variable that was used for building
PostgreSQL\&. This shows linker switches used for building shared libraries only\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-libs\fR
.RS 4
Print the value of the
\fILIBS\fR
variable that was used for building
PostgreSQL\&. This normally contains
\-l
switches for external libraries linked into
PostgreSQL\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-version\fR
.RS 4
Print the version of
PostgreSQL\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-?\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Show help about
pg_config
command line arguments, and exit\&.
.RE
If more than one option is given, the information is printed in that order, one item per line\&. If no options are given, all available information is printed, with labels\&.
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
The option
\fB\-\-includedir\-server\fR
was added in
PostgreSQL
7\&.2\&. In prior releases, the server include files were installed in the same location as the client headers, which could be queried with the option
\fB\-\-includedir\fR\&. To make your package handle both cases, try the newer option first and test the exit status to see whether it succeeded\&.
.PP
The options
\fB\-\-docdir\fR,
\fB\-\-pkgincludedir\fR,
\fB\-\-localedir\fR,
\fB\-\-mandir\fR,
\fB\-\-sharedir\fR,
\fB\-\-sysconfdir\fR,
\fB\-\-cc\fR,
\fB\-\-cppflags\fR,
\fB\-\-cflags\fR,
\fB\-\-cflags_sl\fR,
\fB\-\-ldflags\fR,
\fB\-\-ldflags_sl\fR, and
\fB\-\-libs\fR
were added in
PostgreSQL
8\&.1\&. The option
\fB\-\-htmldir\fR
was added in
PostgreSQL
8\&.4\&. The option
\fB\-\-ldflags_ex\fR
was added in
PostgreSQL
9\&.0\&.
.PP
In releases prior to
PostgreSQL
7\&.1, before
\fBpg_config\fR
came to be, a method for finding the equivalent configuration information did not exist\&.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.PP
To reproduce the build configuration of the current PostgreSQL installation, run the following command:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
eval \&./configure `pg_config \-\-configure`
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The output of
pg_config \-\-configure
contains shell quotation marks so arguments with spaces are represented correctly\&. Therefore, using
eval
is required for proper results\&.
