Upgrading Dovecot v2.1 to v2.2
==============================

v2.2 has a couple of changes to settings since v2.1:

 * doveadm_proxy_port setting renamed to doveadm_port (but the old exists still
   as an alias)
 * imapc_ssl_ca_dir and pop3c_ssl_ca_dir settings replaced by a common
   ssl_client_ca_dir

There are also some changes you should be aware of:

 * When creating home directories, the permissions are copied from the parent
   directory if it has setgid-bit set. For full details, see
   <SharedMailboxes.Permissions.txt>.
 * "doveadm auth" command was renamed to "doveadm auth test"
 * IMAP: ID command now advertises server name as Dovecot by default. It was
   already trivial to guess this from command replies.
 * LDA/LMTP: If saving a mail brings user from under quota to over quota, allow
   it based on quota_grace setting (default: 10% above quota limit).
 * pop3_lock_session=yes now uses a POP3-only dovecot-pop3-session.lock file
   instead of actually locking the mailbox (and causing IMAP/LDA/LMTP to wait
   for the POP3 session to close).
 * mail_shared_explicit_inbox setting's default switched to "no".
 * dsync isn't compatible with v2.1 protocol. (The new protocol will be
   compatible with future Dovecot versions.)
 * autocreate plugin is being deprecated and it will log warnings. Convert the
   configuration to <MailboxSettings.txt> instead.

Downgrading can be done fully safely to v2.1.16.

 * v2.1.16 adds support for "attribute changes", which are used by URLAUTH
   command and dsync with ACLs and/or Sieve scripts. If none of these features
   are used, you can downgrade safely to v2.1.11.
    * The error message for these attribute changes is: 'Log synchronization
      error at seq=..,offset=.. for .../dbox-Mails/dovecot.index: Unknown
      transaction record type 0x0'
 * v2.1.11 adds support for cache file changes. Older versions may think that
   the 'dovecot.index.cache' files are corrupted and complain about "Invalid
   magic in hole header".
