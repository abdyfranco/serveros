.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP

\fBCREATE OPERATOR CLASS\fR
creates a new operator class\&. An operator class defines how a particular data type can be used with an index\&. The operator class specifies that certain operators will fill particular roles or
\(lqstrategies\(rq
for this data type and this index method\&. The operator class also specifies the support procedures to be used by the index method when the operator class is selected for an index column\&. All the operators and functions used by an operator class must be defined before the operator class can be created\&.
.PP
If a schema name is given then the operator class is created in the specified schema\&. Otherwise it is created in the current schema\&. Two operator classes in the same schema can have the same name only if they are for different index methods\&.
.PP
The user who defines an operator class becomes its owner\&. Presently, the creating user must be a superuser\&. (This restriction is made because an erroneous operator class definition could confuse or even crash the server\&.)
.PP

\fBCREATE OPERATOR CLASS\fR
does not presently check whether the operator class definition includes all the operators and functions required by the index method, nor whether the operators and functions form a self\-consistent set\&. It is the user\*(Aqs responsibility to define a valid operator class\&.
.PP
Related operator classes can be grouped into
operator families\&. To add a new operator class to an existing family, specify the
FAMILY
option in
\fBCREATE OPERATOR CLASS\fR\&. Without this option, the new class is placed into a family named the same as the new class (creating that family if it doesn\*(Aqt already exist)\&.
.PP
Refer to
Section 35.14, \(lqInterfacing Extensions To Indexes\(rq, in the documentation
for further information\&.
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.PP
\fIname\fR
.RS 4
The name of the operator class to be created\&. The name can be schema\-qualified\&.
.RE
.PP
DEFAULT
.RS 4
If present, the operator class will become the default operator class for its data type\&. At most one operator class can be the default for a specific data type and index method\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIdata_type\fR
.RS 4
The column data type that this operator class is for\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIindex_method\fR
.RS 4
The name of the index method this operator class is for\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIfamily_name\fR
.RS 4
The name of the existing operator family to add this operator class to\&. If not specified, a family named the same as the operator class is used (creating it, if it doesn\*(Aqt already exist)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIstrategy_number\fR
.RS 4
The index method\*(Aqs strategy number for an operator associated with the operator class\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIoperator_name\fR
.RS 4
The name (optionally schema\-qualified) of an operator associated with the operator class\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIop_type\fR
.RS 4
In an
OPERATOR
clause, the operand data type(s) of the operator, or
NONE
to signify a left\-unary or right\-unary operator\&. The operand data types can be omitted in the normal case where they are the same as the operator class\*(Aqs data type\&.
.sp
In a
FUNCTION
clause, the operand data type(s) the function is intended to support, if different from the input data type(s) of the function (for B\-tree comparison functions and hash functions) or the class\*(Aqs data type (for B\-tree sort support functions and all functions in GiST, SP\-GiST and GIN operator classes)\&. These defaults are correct, and so
\fIop_type\fR
need not be specified in
FUNCTION
clauses, except for the case of a B\-tree sort support function that is meant to support cross\-data\-type comparisons\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIsort_family_name\fR
.RS 4
The name (optionally schema\-qualified) of an existing
btree
operator family that describes the sort ordering associated with an ordering operator\&.
.sp
If neither
FOR SEARCH
nor
FOR ORDER BY
is specified,
FOR SEARCH
is the default\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIsupport_number\fR
.RS 4
The index method\*(Aqs support procedure number for a function associated with the operator class\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIfunction_name\fR
.RS 4
The name (optionally schema\-qualified) of a function that is an index method support procedure for the operator class\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIargument_type\fR
.RS 4
The parameter data type(s) of the function\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIstorage_type\fR
.RS 4
The data type actually stored in the index\&. Normally this is the same as the column data type, but some index methods (currently GiST and GIN) allow it to be different\&. The
STORAGE
clause must be omitted unless the index method allows a different type to be used\&.
.RE
.PP
The
OPERATOR,
FUNCTION, and
STORAGE
clauses can appear in any order\&.
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
Because the index machinery does not check access permissions on functions before using them, including a function or operator in an operator class is tantamount to granting public execute permission on it\&. This is usually not an issue for the sorts of functions that are useful in an operator class\&.
.PP
The operators should not be defined by SQL functions\&. A SQL function is likely to be inlined into the calling query, which will prevent the optimizer from recognizing that the query matches an index\&.
.PP
Before
PostgreSQL
8\&.4, the
OPERATOR
clause could include a
RECHECK
option\&. This is no longer supported because whether an index operator is
\(lqlossy\(rq
is now determined on\-the\-fly at run time\&. This allows efficient handling of cases where an operator might or might not be lossy\&.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
The following example command defines a GiST index operator class for the data type
_int4
(array of
int4)\&. See the
intarray
module for the complete example\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
CREATE OPERATOR CLASS gist__int_ops
    DEFAULT FOR TYPE _int4 USING gist AS
        OPERATOR        3       &&,
        OPERATOR        6       = (anyarray, anyarray),
        OPERATOR        7       @>,
        OPERATOR        8       <@,
        OPERATOR        20      @@ (_int4, query_int),
        FUNCTION        1       g_int_consistent (internal, _int4, int, oid, internal),
        FUNCTION        2       g_int_union (internal, internal),
        FUNCTION        3       g_int_compress (internal),
        FUNCTION        4       g_int_decompress (internal),
        FUNCTION        5       g_int_penalty (internal, internal, internal),
        FUNCTION        6       g_int_picksplit (internal, internal),
        FUNCTION        7       g_int_same (_int4, _int4, internal);
