\fBCOPY\fR
moves data between
PostgreSQL
tables and standard file\-system files\&.
\fBCOPY TO\fR
copies the contents of a table
\fIto\fR
a file, while
\fBCOPY FROM\fR
copies data
\fIfrom\fR
a file to a table (appending the data to whatever is in the table already)\&.
\fBCOPY TO\fR
can also copy the results of a
\fBSELECT\fR
query\&.
.PP
If a list of columns is specified,
\fBCOPY\fR
will only copy the data in the specified columns to or from the file\&. If there are any columns in the table that are not in the column list,
\fBCOPY FROM\fR
will insert the default values for those columns\&.
.PP

\fBCOPY\fR
with a file name instructs the
PostgreSQL
server to directly read from or write to a file\&. The file must be accessible to the server and the name must be specified from the viewpoint of the server\&. When
PROGRAM
is specified, the server executes the given command, and reads from its standard input, or writes to its standard output\&. The command must be specified from the viewpoint of the server, and be executable by the
postgres
user\&. When
STDIN
or
STDOUT
is specified, data is transmitted via the connection between the client and the server\&.
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.PP
\fItable_name\fR
.RS 4
The name (optionally schema\-qualified) of an existing table\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIcolumn_name\fR
.RS 4
An optional list of columns to be copied\&. If no column list is specified, all columns of the table will be copied\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIquery\fR
.RS 4
A
\fBSELECT\fR(7)
or
\fBVALUES\fR(7)
command whose results are to be copied\&. Note that parentheses are required around the query\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIfilename\fR
.RS 4
The path name of the input or output file\&. An input file name can be an absolute or relative path, but an output file name must be an absolute path\&. Windows users might need to use an
E\*(Aq\*(Aq
string and double any backslashes used in the path name\&.
.RE
.PP
PROGRAM
.RS 4
A command to execute\&. In
\fBCOPY FROM\fR, the input is read from standard output of the command, and in
\fBCOPY TO\fR, the output is written to the standard input of the command\&.
.sp
Note that the command is invoked by the shell, so if you need to pass any arguments to shell command that come from an untrusted source, you must be careful to strip or escape any special characters that might have a special meaning for the shell\&. For security reasons, it is best to use a fixed command string, or at least avoid passing any user input in it\&.
.RE
.PP
STDIN
.RS 4
Specifies that input comes from the client application\&.
.RE
.PP
STDOUT
.RS 4
Specifies that output goes to the client application\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIboolean\fR
.RS 4
Specifies whether the selected option should be turned on or off\&. You can write
TRUE,
ON, or
1
to enable the option, and
FALSE,
OFF, or
0
to disable it\&. The
\fIboolean\fR
value can also be omitted, in which case
TRUE
is assumed\&.
.RE
.PP
FORMAT
.RS 4
Selects the data format to be read or written:
text,
csv
(Comma Separated Values), or
binary\&. The default is
text\&.
.RE
.PP
OIDS
.RS 4
Specifies copying the OID for each row\&. (An error is raised if
OIDS
is specified for a table that does not have OIDs, or in the case of copying a
\fIquery\fR\&.)
.RE
.PP
FREEZE
.RS 4
Requests copying the data with rows already frozen, just as they would be after running the
\fBVACUUM FREEZE\fR
command\&. This is intended as a performance option for initial data loading\&. Rows will be frozen only if the table being loaded has been created or truncated in the current subtransaction, there are no cursors open and there are no older snapshots held by this transaction\&.
.sp
Note that all other sessions will immediately be able to see the data once it has been successfully loaded\&. This violates the normal rules of MVCC visibility and users specifying should be aware of the potential problems this might cause\&.
.RE
.PP
DELIMITER
.RS 4
Specifies the character that separates columns within each row (line) of the file\&. The default is a tab character in text format, a comma in
CSV
format\&. This must be a single one\-byte character\&. This option is not allowed when using
binary
format\&.
.RE
.PP
NULL
.RS 4
Specifies the string that represents a null value\&. The default is
\eN
(backslash\-N) in text format, and an unquoted empty string in
CSV
format\&. You might prefer an empty string even in text format for cases where you don\*(Aqt want to distinguish nulls from empty strings\&. This option is not allowed when using
binary
format\&.

.RE
.RE
.PP
HEADER
.RS 4
Specifies that the file contains a header line with the names of each column in the file\&. On output, the first line contains the column names from the table, and on input, the first line is ignored\&. This option is allowed only when using
CSV
format\&.
.RE
.PP
QUOTE
.RS 4
Specifies the quoting character to be used when a data value is quoted\&. The default is double\-quote\&. This must be a single one\-byte character\&. This option is allowed only when using
CSV
format\&.
.RE
.PP
ESCAPE
.RS 4
Specifies the character that should appear before a data character that matches the
QUOTE
value\&. The default is the same as the
QUOTE
value (so that the quoting character is doubled if it appears in the data)\&. This must be a single one\-byte character\&. This option is allowed only when using
CSV
format\&.
.RE
.PP
FORCE_QUOTE
.RS 4
Forces quoting to be used for all non\-NULL
values in each specified column\&.
NULL
output is never quoted\&. If
*
is specified, non\-NULL
values will be quoted in all columns\&. This option is allowed only in
\fBCOPY TO\fR, and only when using
CSV
format\&.
.RE
.PP
FORCE_NOT_NULL
.RS 4
Do not match the specified columns\*(Aq values against the null string\&. In the default case where the null string is empty, this means that empty values will be read as zero\-length strings rather than nulls, even when they are not quoted\&. This option is allowed only in
\fBCOPY FROM\fR, and only when using
CSV
format\&.
.RE
.PP
ENCODING
.RS 4
Specifies that the file is encoded in the
\fIencoding_name\fR\&. If this option is omitted, the current client encoding is used\&. See the Notes below for more details\&.
.RE
.SH "OUTPUTS"
.PP
On successful completion, a
\fBCOPY\fR
command returns a command tag of the form
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf
COPY \fIcount\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The
\fIcount\fR
is the number of rows copied\&.
.SH "NOTES"
.PP

\fBCOPY\fR
can only be used with plain tables, not with views\&. However, you can write
COPY (SELECT * FROM \fIviewname\fR) TO \&.\&.\&.\&.
.PP

\fBCOPY\fR
only deals with the specific table named; it does not copy data to or from child tables\&. Thus for example
COPY \fItable\fR TO
shows the same data as
SELECT * FROM ONLY \fItable\fR\&. But
COPY (SELECT * FROM \fItable\fR) TO \&.\&.\&.
can be used to dump all of the data in an inheritance hierarchy\&.
.PP
You must have select privilege on the table whose values are read by
\fBCOPY TO\fR, and insert privilege on the table into which values are inserted by
\fBCOPY FROM\fR\&. It is sufficient to have column privileges on the column(s) listed in the command\&.
.PP
Files named in a
\fBCOPY\fR
command are read or written directly by the server, not by the client application\&. Therefore, they must reside on or be accessible to the database server machine, not the client\&. They must be accessible to and readable or writable by the
PostgreSQL
user (the user ID the server runs as), not the client\&. Similarly, the command specified with
PROGRAM
is executed directly by the server, not by the client application, must be executable by the
PostgreSQL
user\&.
\fBCOPY\fR
naming a file or command is only allowed to database superusers, since it allows reading or writing any file that the server has privileges to access\&.
.PP
Do not confuse
\fBCOPY\fR
with the
psql
instruction
\fB\ecopy\fR\&.
\fB\ecopy\fR
invokes
\fBCOPY FROM STDIN\fR
or
\fBCOPY TO STDOUT\fR, and then fetches/stores the data in a file accessible to the
psql
client\&. Thus, file accessibility and access rights depend on the client rather than the server when
\fB\ecopy\fR
is used\&.
.PP
It is recommended that the file name used in
\fBCOPY\fR
always be specified as an absolute path\&. This is enforced by the server in the case of
\fBCOPY TO\fR, but for
\fBCOPY FROM\fR
you do have the option of reading from a file specified by a relative path\&. The path will be interpreted relative to the working directory of the server process (normally the cluster\*(Aqs data directory), not the client\*(Aqs working directory\&.
.PP
Executing a command with
PROGRAM
might be restricted by the operating system\*(Aqs access control mechanisms, such as SELinux\&.
.PP

\fBCOPY FROM\fR
will invoke any triggers and check constraints on the destination table\&. However, it will not invoke rules\&.
.PP

\fBCOPY\fR
input and output is affected by
\fIDateStyle\fR\&. To ensure portability to other
PostgreSQL
installations that might use non\-default
\fIDateStyle\fR
settings,
\fIDateStyle\fR
should be set to
ISO
before using
\fBCOPY TO\fR\&. It is also a good idea to avoid dumping data with
\fIIntervalStyle\fR
set to
sql_standard, because negative interval values might be misinterpreted by a server that has a different setting for
\fIIntervalStyle\fR\&.
.PP
Input data is interpreted according to
ENCODING
option or the current client encoding, and output data is encoded in
ENCODING
or the current client encoding, even if the data does not pass through the client but is read from or written to a file directly by the server\&.
.PP

\fBCOPY\fR
stops operation at the first error\&. This should not lead to problems in the event of a
\fBCOPY TO\fR, but the target table will already have received earlier rows in a
\fBCOPY FROM\fR\&. These rows will not be visible or accessible, but they still occupy disk space\&. This might amount to a considerable amount of wasted disk space if the failure happened well into a large copy operation\&. You might wish to invoke
\fBVACUUM\fR
to recover the wasted space\&.
.SH "FILE FORMATS"
.SS "Text Format"
.PP
When the
text
format is used, the data read or written is a text file with one line per table row\&. Columns in a row are separated by the delimiter character\&. The column values themselves are strings generated by the output function, or acceptable to the input function, of each attribute\*(Aqs data type\&. The specified null string is used in place of columns that are null\&.
\fBCOPY FROM\fR
will raise an error if any line of the input file contains more or fewer columns than are expected\&. If
OIDS
is specified, the OID is read or written as the first column, preceding the user data columns\&.
.PP
End of data can be represented by a single line containing just backslash\-period (\e\&.)\&. An end\-of\-data marker is not necessary when reading from a file, since the end of file serves perfectly well; it is needed only when copying data to or from client applications using pre\-3\&.0 client protocol\&.
.PP
Backslash characters (\e) can be used in the
\fBCOPY\fR
data to quote data characters that might otherwise be taken as row or column delimiters\&. In particular, the following characters
\fImust\fR
be preceded by a backslash if they appear as part of a column value: backslash itself, newline, carriage return, and the current delimiter character\&.
.PP
The specified null string is sent by
\fBCOPY TO\fR
without adding any backslashes; conversely,
\fBCOPY FROM\fR
matches the input against the null string before removing backslashes\&. Therefore, a null string such as
\eN
cannot be confused with the actual data value
\eN
(which would be represented as
\e\eN)\&.
.PP
The following special backslash sequences are recognized by
\fBCOPY FROM\fR:
.TS
allbox tab(:);
lB lB.

       the character with that numeric code
T}
.TE
.sp 1
Presently,
\fBCOPY TO\fR
will never emit an octal or hex\-digits backslash sequence, but it does use the other sequences listed above for those control characters\&.
.PP
Any other backslashed character that is not mentioned in the above table will be taken to represent itself\&. However, beware of adding backslashes unnecessarily, since that might accidentally produce a string matching the end\-of\-data marker (\e\&.) or the null string (\eN
by default)\&. These strings will be recognized before any other backslash processing is done\&.
.PP
It is strongly recommended that applications generating
\fBCOPY\fR
data convert data newlines and carriage returns to the
\en
and
\er
sequences respectively\&. At present it is possible to represent a data carriage return by a backslash and carriage return, and to represent a data newline by a backslash and newline\&. However, these representations might not be accepted in future releases\&. They are also highly vulnerable to corruption if the
\fBCOPY\fR
file is transferred across different machines (for example, from Unix to Windows or vice versa)\&.
.PP

\fBCOPY TO\fR
will terminate each row with a Unix\-style newline (\(lq\en\(rq)\&. Servers running on Microsoft Windows instead output carriage return/newline (\(lq\er\en\(rq), but only for
\fBCOPY\fR
to a server file; for consistency across platforms,
\fBCOPY TO STDOUT\fR
always sends
\(lq\en\(rq
regardless of server platform\&.
\fBCOPY FROM\fR
can handle lines ending with newlines, carriage returns, or carriage return/newlines\&. To reduce the risk of error due to un\-backslashed newlines or carriage returns that were meant as data,
\fBCOPY FROM\fR
will complain if the line endings in the input are not all alike\&.
.SS "CSV Format"
.PP
This format option is used for importing and exporting the Comma Separated Value (CSV) file format used by many other programs, such as spreadsheets\&. Instead of the escaping rules used by
PostgreSQL\*(Aqs standard text format, it produces and recognizes the common CSV escaping mechanism\&.
.PP
The values in each record are separated by the
DELIMITER
character\&. If the value contains the delimiter character, the
QUOTE
character, the
NULL
string, a carriage return, or line feed character, then the whole value is prefixed and suffixed by the
QUOTE
character, and any occurrence within the value of a
QUOTE
character or the
ESCAPE
character is preceded by the escape character\&. You can also use
FORCE_QUOTE
to force quotes when outputting non\-NULL
values in specific columns\&.
.PP
The
CSV
format has no standard way to distinguish a
NULL
value from an empty string\&.
PostgreSQL\*(Aqs
\fBCOPY\fR
handles this by quoting\&. A
NULL
is output as the
NULL
parameter string and is not quoted, while a non\-NULL
value matching the
NULL
parameter string is quoted\&. For example, with the default settings, a
NULL
is written as an unquoted empty string, while an empty string data value is written with double quotes ("")\&. Reading values follows similar rules\&. You can use
FORCE_NOT_NULL
to prevent
NULL
input comparisons for specific columns\&.
.PP
Because backslash is not a special character in the
CSV
format,
\e\&., the end\-of\-data marker, could also appear as a data value\&. To avoid any misinterpretation, a
\e\&.
data value appearing as a lone entry on a line is automatically quoted on output, and on input, if quoted, is not interpreted as the end\-of\-data marker\&. If you are loading a file created by another application that has a single unquoted column and might have a value of
\e\&., you might need to quote that value in the input file\&.

In

.RE
.SS "Binary Format"
.PP
The
binary
format option causes all data to be stored/read as binary format rather than as text\&. It is somewhat faster than the text and
CSV
formats, but a binary\-format file is less portable across machine architectures and
PostgreSQL
versions\&. Also, the binary format is very data type specific; for example it will not work to output binary data from a
smallint
column and read it into an
integer
column, even though that would work fine in text format\&.

Bits 16\-31 are reserved to denote critical file format issues; a reader should abort if it finds an unexpected bit set in this range\&.

The header extension area is envisioned to contain a sequence of self\-identifying chunks\&. The flags field is not intended to tell readers what is in the extension area\&. Specific design of header extension contents is left for a later release\&.

\fBTuples\fR
.RS 4
.PP
Each tuple begins with a 16\-bit integer count of the number of fields in the tuple\&. (Presently, all tuples in a table will have the same count, but that might not always be true\&.) Then, repeated for each field in the tuple, there is a 32\-bit length word followed by that many bytes of field data\&. (The length word does not include itself, and can be zero\&.) As a special case, \-1 indicates a NULL field value\&. No value bytes follow in the NULL case\&.
.PP
There is no alignment padding or any other extra data between fields\&.
.PP
Presently, all data values in a binary\-format file are assumed to be in binary format (format code one)\&. It is anticipated that a future extension might add a header field that allows per\-column format codes to be specified\&.
.PP
To determine the appropriate binary format for the actual tuple data you should consult the
PostgreSQL
source, in particular the
\fB*send\fR
and
\fB*recv\fR
functions for each column\*(Aqs data type (typically these functions are found in the
src/backend/utils/adt/

If OIDs are included in the file, the OID field immediately follows the field\-count word\&. It is a normal field except that it\*(Aqs not included in the field\-count\&.

.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
COPY (SELECT * FROM country WHERE country_name LIKE \*(AqA%\*(Aq) TO \*(Aq/usr1/proj/bray/sql/a_list_countries\&.copy\*(Aq;

To copy into a compressed file, you can pipe the output through an external compression program:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
COPY country TO PROGRAM \*(Aqgzip > /usr1/proj/bray/sql/country_data\&.gz\*(Aq;
.fi
.if n \{\

Here is a sample of data suitable for copying into a table from
STDIN:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
AF      AFGHANISTAN
AL      ALBANIA
DZ      ALGERIA
ZM      ZAMBIA
ZW      ZIMBABWE
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE

.sp
Note that the white space on each line is actually a tab character\&.

The following is the same data, output in binary format\&. The data is shown after filtering through the Unix utility
\fBod \-c\fR\&. The table has three columns; the first has type
char(2), the second has type
text, and the third has type
integer\&. All the rows have a null value in the third column\&.
