Description: A ``setproctitle`` implementation for Python
        ============================================
        
        :author: Daniele Varrazzo
        
        The library allows a process to change its title (as displayed by system tools
        such as ``ps`` and ``top``).
        
        Changing the title is mostly useful in multi-process systems, for example
        when a master process is forked: changing the children's title allows to
        identify the task each process is busy with.  The technique is used by
        PostgreSQL_ and the `OpenSSH Server`_ for example.
        
        The procedure is hardly portable across different systems.  PostgreSQL provides
        a good `multi-platform implementation`__:  this module is a Python wrapper
        around PostgreSQL code.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        You can use ``easy_install`` to install the module: to perform a system-wide
        installation use::
        
            sudo easy_install setproctitle
        
        If you are an unprivileged user or you want to limit installation to a local
        environment, you can use the command::
        
            easy_install -d /target/path setproctitle
        
        Note that ``easy_install`` requires ``/target/path`` to be in your
        ``PYTHONPATH``.
        
        
        Python 3 support
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        As of version 1.1 the module works with Python 3.  In order to install the
        module, you can use the `distribute`_ replacemente for ``easy_install``.
        
        In order to build and test the module under Python 3, the ``Makefile``
        contains some helper targets.
        
        .. _distribute: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        The ``setproctitle`` module exports the following functions:
        
        ``setproctitle(title)``
            Set *title* as the title for the current process.
        
        ``getproctitle()``
            Return the current process title.
        
        
        Environment variables
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        A few environment variables can be used to customize the module behavior:
        
        ``SPT_NOENV``
            Avoid clobbering ``/proc/PID/environ``.
        
            On many platforms, setting the process title will clobber the
            ``environ`` memory area. ``os.environ`` will work as expected from within
            the Python process, but the content of the file ``/proc/PID/environ`` will
            be overwritten.  If you require this file not to be broken you can set the
            ``SPT_NOENV`` environment variable to any non-empty value: in this case
            the maximum length for the title will be limited to the length of the
            command line.
        
        ``SPT_DEBUG``
            Print debug information on ``stderr``.
        
            If the module doesn't work as expected you can set this variable to a
            non-empty value to generate information useful for debugging.  Note that
            the most useful information is printed when the module is imported, not
            when the functions are called.
        
        
        Module status
        -------------
        
        The module can be currently compiled and effectively used on the following
        platforms:
        
        - GNU/Linux
        - BSD
        - MacOS X
        - Windows
        
        Note that on Windows there is no way to change the process string:
        what the module does is to create a *Named Object* whose value can be read
        using a tool such as `Process Explorer`_ (contribution of a more useful tool
        to be used together with ``setproctitle`` would be well accepted).
        
        The module can probably work on HP-UX, but I haven't found any to test with.
        It is unlikely that it can work on Solaris instead.

        Other known implementations and discussions
        -------------------------------------------
        
        - `procname`_: a module exposing the same functionality, but less portable 
          and not well packaged.
        - `Issue 5672`_: where the introduction of such functionality into the stdlib
          is being discussed.

        - The module can be compiled again on Windows (issue #21).
        
        
        Version 1.1.5
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - No module bug, but a packaging issue: files ``README`` and ``HISTORY``
          added back into the distribution.
        
        
        Version 1.1.4
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - The module works correctly in embedded Python.
        - ``setproctitle()`` accepts a keyword argument.
        - Debug output support always compiled in: the variable ``SPT_DEBUG`` can be
          used to emit debug log.
        
        
        Version 1.1.3
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Don't clobber environ if the variable ``SPT_NOENV`` is set (issue #16).
        
        
        Version 1.1.2
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Find the setproctitle include file on OpenBSD (issue #11).
        - Skip test with unicode if the file system encoding wouldn't make it pass
          (issue #13).
        
        
        Version 1.1.1

        Version 1.0.1
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - ``setproctitle()`` works even when Python messes up with argv, e.g. when run
          with the -m option (issue #8).
        
        
        Version 1.0
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        No major change since the previous version.  The module has been heavily used
        in production environment without any problem reported, so it's time to declare
        it stable.
