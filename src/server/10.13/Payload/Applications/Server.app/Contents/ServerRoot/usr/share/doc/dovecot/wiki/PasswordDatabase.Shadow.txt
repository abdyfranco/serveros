Shadow
======

Works at least with Linux and Solaris, but nowadays <PAM>
[PasswordDatabase.PAM.txt] is usually preferred to this.

This uses auth-worker processes:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
passdb {
  driver = shadow
}
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

By default the auth-worker processes are run as "dovecot" user though, which
normally doesn't have access to '/etc/shadow'. If this is a problem, you can
fix it with:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
service auth-worker {
  # This should be enough:
  group = shadow
  # If not, just give full root permissions:
  #user = root
}
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

If there are only a few users and you're using '/etc/shadow' file, there's
really no need to use auth-workers. You can disable them with:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
passdb {
  driver = shadow
  args = blocking=no
}
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
