Authentication Penalty
======================

Dovecot anvil process tracks authentication penalties for different IPs to slow
down brute force login attempts. The algorithm works by:

 * First auth failure reply will be delayed for 2 seconds (this happens even
   without auth penalty)
    * 'AUTH_PENALTY_INIT_SECS' in 'src/auth/auth-penalty.h'
 * The delay will be doubled for 4 -> 8 seconds, and then the upper limit of 15
   seconds is reached.
    * 'AUTH_PENALTY_MAX_SECS' and AUTH_PENALTY_MAX_PENALTY in
      'src/auth/auth-penalty.h'
 * If the IP is in login_trusted_networks (e.g. webmail), skip any
   authentication penalties
 * If the username+password combination is the same as one of the last 10 login
   attempts, skip increasing authentication penalty.
    * 'CHECKSUM_VALUE_PTR_COUNT' in 'src/anvil/penalty.c'
    * The idea is that if a user has simply configured the password wrong, it
      shouldn't keep increasing the delay.
    * The username+password is tracked as the CRC32 of them, so there is a
      small possibility of hash collisions

Problems:

 * It is still possible to do multiple auth lookups from the same IP in
   parallel.
 * For IPv6 it currently blocks the entire /48 block, which may or may not be
   what is wanted.
    * PENALTY_IPV6_MASK_BITS in auth-penalty.c

Authentication penalty tracking can be disabled completely with:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
service anvil {
  unix_listener anvil-auth-penalty {
    mode = 0
  }
}
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Also you can have similar functionality with fail2ban
