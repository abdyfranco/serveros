        Installation
        ============
        
        Python version 2.7 is supported.
        
        This library is can be built using the standard distutils mechanisms.
        
        It is also registered with the Python Package Index (PyPI) as ``twextpy`` 
        (the name ``twext`` is used by another module in PyPI) for use with ``pip`` and
        ``easy_install``::
        
          pip install twextpy
        
        This will build and install the ``twext`` module along with its base
        dependencies.  This library has a number of optional features which must be
        specified in order to download build and install their dependencies, for
        example::
        
          pip install twextpy[DAL,Postgres]
        
        These features are:
        
        DAL
          Enables use of the Database Abstraction Layer implemented in
          ``twext.enterprise.dal``.
        
        LDAP
          Enables support for the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol in
          ``twext.who.ldap``.
        
        OpenDirectory
          Enables support for the (Mac OS) OpenDirectory framework in
          ``twext.who.opendirectory``.
        
        Oracle
          Enables support for Oracle database connectivity in ``twext.enterprise`` and
          Oracle syntax in ``twext.enterprise.dal``.
        
        Postgres
          Enables support for Postgres database connectivity in ``twext.enterprise``.
        
        
        Development
        ===========
        
        If you are planning to work on this library, you can manage this with standard
        distutils mechanisms.  There are, however, some tools in the ``bin`` directory
        which automate this management for you.
        
        To use these tools, you must have ``pip`` on your system.
        If you do not have ``pip``, instructions for installing it are at
        http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html.
        The script ``install_pip`` (requires ``sudo`` access) automates this for you.
        
        The shell script ``develop`` downloads and builds any dependancies and sets up a
        development environment.  ``develop`` handles non-Python as well as Python
        dependancies.
        
        The tools ``python``, ``pyflakes``, ``trial``, and ``twistd`` are wrappers
        around the cooresponding commands that use ``develop`` to ensure that
        dependancies are available, ``PYTHONPATH`` is set up correctly, etc.
        
        ``test`` runs all of the unit tests and does linting.  It should be run before
        checking in any code.
