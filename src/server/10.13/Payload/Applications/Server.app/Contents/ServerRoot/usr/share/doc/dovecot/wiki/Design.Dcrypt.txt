lib-dcrypt
==========

lib-dcrypt is component for abstracting asymmetric and symmetric cryptographic
operations. It can be used for public/private key handling too. Currently we
support OpenSSL backing, but it is possible to write alternative backends for
dcrypt.

ECDH algorithm
--------------

ECDH (Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman) is widely used in lib-dcrypt for both key
and data storage. This algorithm is also known as ECIES
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECIES] (Elliptic curve Integrated Encryption
Scheme).

When encrypting data, we perform following steps, this is the currently used
algorithm. There is also a legacy algorithm, but since that has not been used
publicly, we do not describe it here. You can deduce it from the code if you
want to.

ENCRYPT(RECIPIENT-KEY, DATA):

 1. Ensure recipient key is not point at infinity
 2. Generate new keypair from same group
 3. Choose ephemeral public key as R
 4. Calculate P = R * RECIPIENT-KEY
 5. From P = (x,y) choose x as S
 6. Generate random salt
 7. Use PBKDF2(SHA256, S, salt, 2000) to produce iv+key
 8. Encrypt data
 9. OUTPUT R, salt and encrypted data.

In dcrypt-openssl.c, we use EVP_PKEY_derive_* for the actual derivations.
ephemeral public key is exported with EC_POINT_point2oct in compressed form.

DECRYPT(PRIVATE-KEY, R, SALT, DATA):

 1. Ensure R is not point at infinity
 2. Calculate P = R * PRIVATE-KEY
 3. From P = (x,y) pick x as S
 4. Use PBKDF2(SHA256, S, salt, 2000) to produce iv+key
 5. Decrypt data
 6. OUTPUT decrypted data

Key formats
-----------

lib-dcrypt can consume keys in PEM format [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1421]
(with or without password), and in Dovecot's special format intended for dict
storage.

Dovecot's format consists from unencrypted and encrypted keys. You can encrypt
keys using password or another key. There are also two version, version 1
(deprecated) and version 2 (current). Both versions support either tab or :
separated fields. ECC keys are stored always in compressed form. Version 1
format is not described as it's deprecated and should not be used.

Version 2 format
----------------

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
public key id: HEX(SHA256(public key in DER format))
key data:
  RSA: i2d_PrivateKey
  ECC: BN_bn2mpi using compressed form

public key: 2:HEX(public key in DER format):public key ID
private key (unencrypted)    : 2:key algo oid:0:key data:public key ID
private key (encrypted, key) : 2:key algo oid:1:symmetric algo:salt:digest algo
(for pbkdf2):rounds:encrypted key data:ephemeral public key:digest of
encryption key:public key ID
private key (encrypted, pwd) : 2:key algo oid:2:symmetric algo:salt:digest algo
(for pbkd2f):rounds:encrypted key data:public key ID
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

File format
-----------

This library can also generate encrypted files that are encrypted using
asymmetric key pair. File encryption can be done using whatever algorithm(s)
the underlying library supports. For integrity support, either HMAC based or
AEAD based system is used when requested.

File format is described below

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
000 - 008 CRYPTED\x03\x07 (MAGIC)
009 - 009 \x02 (VERSION FIELD, 2)
010 - 013 MSB flags
014 - 017 MSB total header length (starting from 000)
018 - cod cipher oid in DER format
cod - mod MAC algorithm oid in DER format
mod - +4  MSB PBKDF2 rounds
+5  - +8  MSB length of key data
+9  - +9  number of key blocks
----- key block -----
+10 - +10  key type (1 = RSA, 2 = ECC)
+11 - +43 public key id (SHA256 of public key in DER format, point compressed)
+44 - +48 MSB length of ephemeral key
+49 - epk ephemeral key
epk - +4  MSB length of encrypted key
+4  - ek  encrypted key
----- end of key block (this can then repeat) -----
eokb - +4  MSB length of encryption key hash
+4 - ekh  encryption key hash
ekh - (eof-maclen) payload data

There is a small script for decrypting these files, see
[attachment:decrypt.rb].
