    <A
HREF="runtime-config-client.html#GUC-TIMEZONE-ABBREVIATIONS"
>timezone_abbreviations</A
> run-time parameter
    determines the active set of abbreviations.  While this parameter
    can be altered by any database user, the possible values for it
    are under the control of the database administrator &mdash; they
    are in fact names of configuration files stored in
    <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.../share/timezonesets/</TT
> of the installation directory.
    By adding or altering files in that directory, the administrator
    can set local policy for timezone abbreviations.
   </P

CLASS="VARNAME"
>timezone_abbreviations</TT
> can be set to any file name
    found in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.../share/timezonesets/</TT

    is entirely alphabetic.  (The prohibition against non-alphabetic
    characters in <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>timezone_abbreviations</TT
> prevents reading
    files outside the intended directory, as well as reading editor
    backup files and other extraneous files.)

    the equivalent offset in seconds from UTC, positive being east from
    Greenwich and negative being west.  For example, -18000 would be five
    hours west of Greenwich, or North American east coast standard time.

CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>time_zone_name</I
></TT
> can be given, referencing
    a zone name defined in the IANA timezone database.  The zone's definition
    is consulted to see whether the abbreviation is or has been in use in
    that zone, and if so, the appropriate meaning is used &mdash; that is,
    the meaning that was currently in use at the timestamp whose value is
    being determined, or the meaning in use immediately before that if it
    wasn't current at that time, or the oldest meaning if it was used only
    after that time.  This behavior is essential for dealing with
    abbreviations whose meaning has historically varied.  It is also allowed
    to define an abbreviation in terms of a zone name in which that
    abbreviation does not appear; then using the abbreviation is just
    equivalent to writing out the zone name.

    information about every time zone abbreviation known to be in use
